local?

    Every time, i want to keep my files in safe place like github instead of 
    placing whole of it in local.
    
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because it may better for some reasons such as:
    when i am working on a specfied feauture of application, at the same time another co-worker from the team update an part of application, it will be automatically update for myself and whole my works will be gone.

use one instead of another?

    clone: is clone the repository from github to local machine or from local place to another same one.
    branche: is an specific part to refer commits in one place.
